# ManualTestingProjects
This repository includes all the manual testing projects which I have worked upon so far. I have tested some dummy websites available on Internet to strengthen my testing skills and learn to design effective test cases. I have included the test plan and test cases for different website applications that I had performed testing on. Feel free to take a look and share your feedback as well.
Thank you :)
